# 🌍 Groundwater Level Analysis 💧

This project analyzes groundwater levels based on various environmental and geographical factors, aiming to forecast groundwater availability both spatially and temporally.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Data preprocessing and cleaning**
- 📉 **Handling missing values** using multiple imputation techniques
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization**
- ⚠️ **Outlier detection and removal** using statistical methods
- 🤖 **Predictive modeling** for groundwater level forecasting
- 🖥️ **Web-based visualization** for user interaction

## 🔄 Data Processing Steps
1. **📂 Loading Data**: The dataset contains attributes like rainfall, hydrogeology, land use, population, surface elevation, natural features, and tidal cycles.
2. **🛠️ Handling Missing Values**:
   - Missing data is imputed using statistical and machine learning-based methods.
3. **🚨 Outlier Detection and Removal**:
   - Extreme values are detected using **IQR (Interquartile Range)** and **Z-score** methods.
   - 📌 Box plots and scatter plots are used for visualization.
4. **📊 Data Visualization**:
   - Various plots (**histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices**) help in understanding trends and anomalies.

## 🔬 Model Development
- 🏆 **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM are used for prediction.
- 📏 **Performance Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.

## ⚡ Installation
