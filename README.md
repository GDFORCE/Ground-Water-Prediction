## Introduction

Effective groundwater management requires reliable prediction models. Traditional methods often fall short due to the complex nature of groundwater systems. This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning to enhance the accuracy of groundwater level forecasts.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:

- **DWLR_Dataset_2023.csv**: Contains historical groundwater level measurements along with relevant environmental parameters.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Normalizing data.
   - Feature selection.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Implemented various machine learning algorithms.
   - Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Compared predictions against actual groundwater levels.
   - Fine-tuned model parameters for optimal performance.

## Model Architecture

The predictive model is built using a [specific machine learning algorithm, e.g., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network]. The architecture includes:

- Input layer corresponding to selected features.
- Hidden layers with [number of neurons and activation functions].
- Output layer predicting groundwater levels.

*Note: Replace placeholders with actual details from your model.*

## Results

The model achieved:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: [value]
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: [value]

These results indicate [brief interpretation of model performance].
